            <img src='src\assets\headshot.PNG' />
            <p>I am a full-stack web developer seeking to apply my eight years of tech support management expertise to the web. After spending time learning how end users think and knowing what they look for, I want to hone my web development skills into creating a user experience that aligns with their wants and needs. I am enthusiastic about technology and always eager to learn more. I have a BA in Information Systems Management, a master's degree in Business Administration, and I recently acquired a web development certificate through a rigorous course at Denver University. I'm looking to bring my commitment to excellence and hard work ethic to a company and become a valuable asset.
